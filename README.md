[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/alqa3coqq44j25ul/branch/master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rickbeerendonk/transit-csharp/branch/master)

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between applications written in different languages. This library provides support for marshalling Transit data to/from C#.

* [Rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [API docs](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-java/)
* [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is a work in progress and may evolve based on feedback. As a result, while Transit is a great option for transferring data between applications, it should not yet be used for storing data durably over time. This recommendation will change when the specification is complete._
